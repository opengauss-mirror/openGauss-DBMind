        The page you see is a test page for DBMind. <br>
        It would help if you built DBMind UI using npm then deployed it into
        the current directory.
    </b>
    <p>
        You can build the UI asserts by using Makefile in the root directory as follows:
    </p>
    <code>
        make ui
    </code>
    <p>
        Or build them using npm:
    </p>
    <code>
        cd ui <br>
        npm install <br>
        npm run build <br>
    </code>
</html>
