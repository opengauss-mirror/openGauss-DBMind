        In statistics, the median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure
            of the variability of a univariate sample of quantitative data.
        For a univariate data set X1, X2, ..., Xn, the MAD is defined as the median
            of the absolute deviations from the data's median:
            MAD = abs(x - x.median).median * scale_factor

        parameters:
        threshold (float, optional): threshold to decide a anomaly data. Defaults to 3.
        scale_factor (float, optional): Multiple relationship between standard deviation and absolute
            median difference under normal distribution.
